### How to Start the Frontend
1. Run the Backend through Gradle (Gradle tab > Tasks > application > run)
   - Frontend will work if you don't do this, but backend api requests won't load obviously
2. Navigate to frontend directory in terminal with `cd frontend`
3. `npm run dev` should run the frontend on http://localhost:5173/
